`#AWS` 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud IaaS
------------------------------------

There are four broad categories of customer need in cloud IaaS:
1. Digital business enablement
2. Mode 2, agile IT projects
3. Mode 1, traditional IT data center substitution
4. Batch computing

AWS named as a leader in the Gartner Public Cloud IaaS for the 7th straight year

### Microsoft Azure
offers Hyper-V-virtualized multitenant compute (Virtual Machines),
with multitenant storage, along with many additional IaaS and PaaS capabilities,
a Docker-based container service (Azure Container Service), a batch computing service (Azure Batch) and event-driven "serverless computing" (Azure Functions).
The Azure Marketplace offers third-party software and services.Colocation needs are met via partner exchanges (Azure ExpressRoute).
Microsoft's strong commitment to cloud services has been rewarded with significant market success.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
combines an IaaS offering (Compute Engine), an aPaaS offering (App Engine) and a range of complementary IaaS and PaaS capabilities,
including a Docker container service (Container Engine) and event-driven "serverless computing" (Google Cloud Functions, in beta).
Compute Engine VMs are KVM-virtualized and metered by the minute. Enterprise-grade support is extra. It has a multi-fault-domain SLA. Colocation needs are met via partner exchanges (Google Cloud Interconnect).
Gartner estimates that GCP is a distant *third* in cloud IaaS and integrated IaaS+PaaS market share. Google has massive investments in infrastructure for Google as a whole.

### Alibaba Cloud
Alibaba Cloud is the current cloud IaaS market share leader in China, and is classified as MLPS Level 4. Its mainland China data centers are located in Beijing, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Zhangbei. Alibaba Cloud has a broader scope of services within China than it does internationally. 

Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. AWS and Azure deliver their Chinese regions in conjunction with Chinese partners, and thus their offerings in China are somewhat different than their global offerings.
